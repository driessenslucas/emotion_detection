This project implements real-time emotion detection using a webcam feed. It uses OpenCV for face detection and a pre-trained deep learning model to classify emotions into three categories: angry, happy, and sad.

- Features
  - Real-time face detection using Haar Cascade classifier
  - Emotion classification using a pre-trained TensorFlow model
  - Live webcam feed with bounding boxes and emotion labels
